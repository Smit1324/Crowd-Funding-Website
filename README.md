Hello there coders,
How are you all doing ??
Hope you are doing just fine.

So, Basically this is a Crowd Funding Website that I made for a company as an intern.
Crowd Funding means we are raising capital and collecting funds through public and for that purpose, I was asked to make this awesome website.

In FrontEnd, I used React JS which is a framework of HTML, CSS and JS. To store data, I used a mock API (Application Programming Interface) and then I connected the API with my FrontEnd through React JS.
I used POST method to store data whenever a user Signed Up. I used some protocols like user have to fill the full form without leaving any mandatory fields to register a new entry.
I used GET method to get the data of registered user. Obviously, user must be a registered one. If the user is not registered and still tried to login then an ERROR is thrown. I used basic coding to authenticate through email and password of registerd users.

Thank you for visiting
Have fun !!!
